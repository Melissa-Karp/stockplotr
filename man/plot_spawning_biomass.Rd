\usage{
plot_spawning_biomass(
  dat,
  model = c("SS3", "BAM", "ASAP", "AMAK", "WHAM"),
  refpts = FALSE,
  show_warnings = FALSE,
  units = NULL,
  ref_line = c("target", "MSY", "msy", "unfished"),
  endyr = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{Stock assessment output file containing estimates parameters and
other associated metrics.}

\item{model}{Acryonym of the stock assessment model that produced the output file.
Currently, only stock synthesis (SS3) and Beaufort Assessment Model (BAM)
are options for plotting spawning biomass.}

\item{refpts}{Output a dataframe of reference points for spawning biomass
rather than plot. Default is FALSE.}

\item{show_warnings}{Option to suppress warnings}

\item{units}{If units are not available in the output file or are not the
default of metric tons, then state the units of spawning biomass applicable
to the stock. For plotting purposes, spawning biomass is divided by 1000.}

\item{ref_line}{choose with reference point to plot a reference line and use
in relative sb calculations}

\item{endyr}{input the end year of the stock assessment data (not including
projections). This parameter will be depricated once the output converter is fully developed.}
}
\value{
Plot spawning biomass from a stock assessment model as found in a NOAA
stock assessment report. Units of spawning biomass can either be manually added
or will be extracted from the provided file if possible.
