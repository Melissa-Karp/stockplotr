kobe,figure,"Kobe plot showing stock status. Triangles delineate start and end years. Horizontal and vertical dashed lines delineate reference points for overfishing (i.e., F/FMSY>1) and overfished status (i.e., B/BMSY <1) where MSY represents either actual maximum sustainable yield or a proxy for MSY.","A Kobe plot showing stock status from start_year_kobe to end_year_kobe. The x axis, showing overfished status (i.e., B/BMSY), spans from B_div_BMSY_min to B_div_BMSY_max and the y axis, showing overfishing (i.e., F/FMSY), spans from F_div_FMSY_min to F_div_FMSY_max. The B/BMSY and F/FMSY for end_year_kobe were B_div_BMSY_end_yr and F_div_FMSY_end_yr, respectively, indicating that the stock overfished_status_is_isnot overfished and overfishing_status_is_is_not experiencing overfishing."
biomass,figure,Biomass time series. The horizontal dashed line represents the limit reference point (B_ref_pt B_ref_pt_unit).,"Line graph showing biomass time series from B_start_year to B_end_year. The x axis, showing the year, spans from B_start_year to B_end_year and the y axis, showing biomass in B_units (i.e., B), spans from B_min to B_max. The limit reference point is (B_ref_pt B_ref_pt_unit)."
mortality,figure,Fishing mortality (F) over time. The horizontal dashed line represents the target reference point (F_ref_pt F_ref_pt_unit).,"Line graph showing fishing mortality over time from F_start_year to F_end_year . The x axis, showing the year, spans from F_start_year to F_end_year and the y axis, showing fishing mortality in F_units (i.e., F), spans from F_min to F_max. The horizontal dashed line represents the target reference point (F_ref_pt F_ref_pt_unit)."
landings,figure,Historical landings by fleet.,"Cumulative area plot showing historical landings from landings_start_year to landings_end_year. The x axis, showing the year, spans from landings_start_year to landings_end_year and the y axis, showing landings in landings_units, spans from landings_min to landings_max."
length_type_conversion,figure,Length measuring type conversion relationship between total and fork length where points represent individual fish length measurement observations and the line is the fitted relationship. ,"Point and line graph showing observations of measured fork length and measured total length from the same fish for conversion purposes as points, and a linear fit through those points as a line. The x axis, showing total length in total_length_units, spans from total_length_min to total_length_max and the y axis, showing fork length in fork_length_units, spans from fork_length_min to fork_length_max."
