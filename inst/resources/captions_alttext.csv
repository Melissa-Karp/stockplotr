kobe,figure,"Kobe plot showing stock status. Triangles delineate start and end years. Horizontal and vertical dashed lines delineate reference points for overfishing (i.e., F/FMSY>1) and overfished status (i.e., B/BMSY <1) where MSY represents either actual maximum sustainable yield or a proxy for MSY.","A Kobe plot showing stock status from start_year_kobe to end_year_kobe. The x axis, showing overfished status (i.e., B/BMSY), spans from B_div_BMSY_min to B_div_BMSY_max and the y axis, showing overfishing (i.e., F/FMSY), spans from F_div_FMSY_min to F_div_FMSY_max. The B/BMSY and F/FMSY for end_year_kobe were B_div_BMSY_end_yr and F_div_FMSY_end_yr, respectively, indicating that the stock overfished_status_is_isnot overfished and overfishing_status_is_is_not experiencing overfishing."
biomass,figure,Biomass time series. The horizontal dashed line represents the limit reference point (B_ref_pt B_ref_pt_unit).,"Line graph showing biomass time series from B_start_year to B_end_year. The x axis, showing the year, spans from B_start_year to B_end_year and the y axis, showing biomass in B_units (i.e., B), spans from B_min to B_max. The limit reference point is (B_ref_pt B_ref_pt_unit)."
mortality,figure,Fishing mortality (F) over time. The horizontal dashed line represents the target reference point (F_ref_pt F_ref_pt_unit).,"Line graph showing fishing mortality over time from F_start_year to F_end_year . The x axis, showing the year, spans from F_start_year to F_end_year and the y axis, showing fishing mortality in F_units (i.e., F), spans from F_min to F_max. The horizontal dashed line represents the target reference point (F_ref_pt F_ref_pt_unit)."
