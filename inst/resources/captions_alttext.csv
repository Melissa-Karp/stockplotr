kobe,figure,"Kobe plot showing stock status. Triangles delineate start and end years. Horizontal and vertical dashed lines delineate reference points for overfishing (i.e., F/FMSY>1) and overfished status (i.e., B/BMSY <1) where MSY represents either actual maximum sustainable yield or a proxy for MSY.","A Kobe plot showing stock status from start year to end year. The x axis, showing overfished status (i.e., B/BMSY), spans from B_div_BMSY_min to B_div_BMSY_max and the y axis, showing overfishing (i.e., F/FMSY), spans from F_div_FMSY_min to F_div_FMSY_max. The B/BMSY and F/FMSY for end year were B_div_BMSY_end_yr and F_div_FMSY_end_yr, respectively, indicating that the stock overfished_status_is_isnot overfished and overfishing_status_is_is_not experiencing overfishing."
